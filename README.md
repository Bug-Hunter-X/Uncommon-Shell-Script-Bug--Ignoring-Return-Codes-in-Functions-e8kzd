This repository demonstrates a subtle but significant error in a shell script related to the handling of return codes from functions.  The script attempts to process a file, but it fails to correctly check and handle errors when the file is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.  The solution demonstrates the proper way to check the return code and handle errors gracefully.
